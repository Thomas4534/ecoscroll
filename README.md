# Eco Scroll

**Eco Scroll** is a purpose-driven, social media-style infinite scrolling app where **user engagement directly funds charitable causes**. Instead of scrolling aimlessly, users support real-world impact — and the most engaged scroller each month receives a **cash prize**.

Currently in **demo mode**, Eco Scroll runs locally with minimal setup and showcases a scalable model where **digital attention becomes a force for good**.
